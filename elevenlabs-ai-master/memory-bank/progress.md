# Progress: ElevenLabs AI Call App

## What Works

### Core Functionality
- âœ… **AudioSocket Protocol**: Implementation of Asterisk's AudioSocket protocol for bidirectional audio streaming
- âœ… **ElevenLabs Integration**: Connection to ElevenLabs conversational AI service
- âœ… **Dynamic Port Management**: Allocation and management of ports for multiple concurrent calls
- âœ… **WebSocket API**: Interface for controlling and monitoring the application
- âœ… **Connection Management**: Tracking and management of active connections and resources
- âœ… **Asterisk AMI Integration**: Interface with Asterisk Manager API for call control

### Call Handling
- âœ… **Outbound Calls**: Ability to initiate outbound calls via Asterisk
- âœ… **Inbound Calls**: Support for receiving inbound calls via AudioSocket
- âœ… **Audio Streaming**: Bidirectional audio streaming between callers and AI agents
- âœ… **Call Termination**: Proper handling of call termination and resource cleanup

### Management Features
- âœ… **Agent Configuration**: Support for configuring different AI agents
- âœ… **Call Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of active calls via WebSocket
- âœ… **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of system events and errors
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Basic error handling and recovery mechanisms

## What's Left to Build

### Backend Enhancements
- ðŸ”„ **Database Operations Commands**: Extend backend control commands to utilize DatabaseManager.cjs functions (en/disableAgentByCampaignId, en/disableAgentByUserId)
- ðŸ”„ **Agent Assignment System**: Create new "assignAgents" command for campaign-agent assignment with proper SQL integration
- ðŸ”„ **Auto-Refresh Mechanism**: Implement automatic data refresh after update commands
- ðŸ”„ **Character Encoding**: Clean up latin1/utf8mb4 charset mixup in database for proper dynamic field usage

### OSdial Integration

- ðŸ”„ **Dialplan Integration**: Custom dialplan entries for AI agent extensions
- ðŸ”„ **Campaign Integration**: Configuration of OSdial campaigns to use AI agents
- ðŸ”„ **Helper Scripts**: Scripts for dynamic port allocation and agent initialization

### Deployment
- ðŸ”„ **Environment Configuration**: Finalization of environment variable configuration
- ðŸ”„ **Deployment Documentation**: Documentation of deployment process
- ðŸ”„ **Startup Scripts**: Creation of startup scripts and service definitions
- ðŸ”„ **Docker Support**: Optional containerization for easier deployment

### Advanced Features
- ðŸ”„ **Call Transfer**: Ability to transfer calls between AI agents and human agents
- ðŸ”„ **Call Recording**: Integration with call recording systems
- ðŸ”„ **Analytics**: Collection and reporting of call analytics
- ðŸ”„ **Admin Interface**: Web-based administration interface

## Current Status

The ElevenLabs AI Call App is currently in a **functional prototype** state. The core functionality for handling calls with ElevenLabs AI agents is working, but integration with OSdial as virtual/remote agents is still in the planning and early implementation phase.

### Development Status
- **Core Application**: Complete and functional
- **OSdial Integration**: Planning and design phase
- **Documentation**: In progress
- **Testing**: Basic functionality tested, integration testing pending

### Integration Status
- **Asterisk Integration**: Functional via AudioSocket and AMI
- **ElevenLabs API Integration**: Complete and functional
- **OSdial Integration**: Not yet implemented

## Known Issues

### Technical Issues
1. **Port Exhaustion**: The current port allocation system has a fixed range, which limits the number of concurrent calls
2. **Error Recovery**: Some error scenarios may not be properly handled, leading to resource leaks
3. **Memory Usage**: High concurrency may lead to excessive memory usage
4. **Latency**: Audio processing introduces some latency in the conversation flow

### Integration Issues
1. **OSdial Compatibility**: The integration approach with OSdial as remote agents needs validation
2. **Asterisk Version Dependency**: Requires Asterisk 16+ with AudioSocket support
3. **ElevenLabs API Limits**: Subject to ElevenLabs API rate limits and quotas

### Deployment Issues
1. **Configuration Complexity**: Many environment variables need to be properly configured
2. **Network Requirements**: Requires specific network configuration for proper operation
3. **Monitoring**: Limited built-in monitoring capabilities

## Next Milestones
