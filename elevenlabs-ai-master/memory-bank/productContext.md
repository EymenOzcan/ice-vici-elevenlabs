# Product Context: ElevenLabs AI Call App

## Why This Project Exists
The ElevenLabs AI Call App was created to bridge the gap between advanced conversational AI technology and traditional call center systems. By integrating ElevenLabs' AI agents with OSdial/Vicidial, this application enables call centers to leverage AI for handling routine calls, improving efficiency, and providing consistent customer experiences without completely replacing existing infrastructure.

## Problems It Solves

### For Call Centers
1. **Staffing Challenges**: AI agents can handle calls during peak times or off-hours when human staffing is limited.
2. **Consistency Issues**: Unlike human agents who may vary in performance, AI agents deliver consistent responses and follow protocols precisely.
3. **Scalability Constraints**: AI agents can be instantly deployed to handle increased call volumes without hiring and training delays.
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces the cost per call by automating routine interactions that don't require human judgment.

### For System Integrators
1. **Technology Gap**: Bridges the gap between modern AI services and legacy call center systems.
2. **Complex Integration**: Simplifies the technical complexity of connecting real-time voice calls with cloud-based AI services.
3. **Audio Processing**: Handles the complex audio streaming and processing required for natural conversations.

### For End Users
1. **Wait Times**: Reduces wait times by providing immediate service through AI agents.
2. **24/7 Availability**: Enables round-the-clock service availability.
3. **Consistent Experience**: Provides a consistent interaction experience regardless of when the call occurs.

## How It Should Work

### Call Flow
1. A call is routed to an AI agent extension in OSdial/Vicidial
2. Asterisk connects the call to the ElevenLabs AI Call App via AudioSocket
3. The app establishes a connection with ElevenLabs' conversational AI service
4. Audio is streamed bidirectionally between the caller and the AI agent
5. The AI agent handles the conversation based on its training and configuration
6. When the call ends, the connection is properly terminated and resources are released

### User Interaction Model
- **Seamless Experience**: Callers should not immediately perceive they are talking to an AI
- **Natural Conversation**: The AI should support natural dialogue with appropriate pauses and responses
- **Interruption Handling**: The system should handle interruptions and overlapping speech
- **Error Recovery**: If misunderstandings occur, the AI should gracefully recover

## User Experience Goals

### For Call Center Administrators
- **Easy Configuration**: Simple setup and configuration of AI agents within OSdial
- **Monitoring Capabilities**: Ability to monitor AI agent performance and call metrics
- **Campaign Integration**: Seamless integration with existing call campaigns
- **Agent Management**: Manage AI agents alongside human agents in the same interface

### For Callers
- **Natural Interaction**: Conversations should feel natural and responsive
- **Minimal Latency**: Audio processing should introduce minimal delay in the conversation
- **Problem Resolution**: AI agents should effectively resolve caller issues or route to humans when necessary
- **Voice Quality**: Clear audio quality for both the caller and AI agent

## Success Metrics
- **Call Completion Rate**: Percentage of calls successfully handled by AI agents
- **Average Handle Time**: Time taken to resolve caller issues
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback scores from callers who interacted with AI agents
- **System Reliability**: Uptime and error rates of the AI call handling system
- **Cost Savings**: Reduction in cost per call compared to human agent handling
