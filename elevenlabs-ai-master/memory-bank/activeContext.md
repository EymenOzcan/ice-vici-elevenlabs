# Active Context: ElevenLabs AI Call App

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on integrating the ElevenLabs AI Call App with OSdial (a fork of Vicidial) to enable AI agents to appear as remote/virtual agents within the OSdial system. This integration will allow the call center to route calls to AI agents through the standard OSdial campaign and agent management interfaces.

### Key Integration Points
1. Configuring AI agents as remote agents in OSdial
2. Setting up Asterisk dialplan to route calls to the ElevenLabs AI Call App
3. Ensuring proper audio streaming between callers and AI agents
4. Managing call lifecycle within the OSdial environment

## Recent Changes

The ElevenLabs AI Call App has been developed with the following key components:

1. **AudioSocket Integration**: Implementation of the AudioSocket protocol for bidirectional audio streaming with Asterisk
2. **Dynamic Port Management**: System for allocating and managing ports for multiple concurrent calls
3. **ElevenLabs API Integration**: Connection to ElevenLabs conversational AI service for natural language processing and voice synthesis
4. **WebSocket API**: Interface for controlling and monitoring the application
5. **Connection Management**: System for tracking and managing active connections and resources

## Next Steps

### 1. OSdial Integration
- Create custom dialplan entries for AI agent extensions
- Configure AI agents as remote agents in OSdial
- Set up helper scripts for dynamic port allocation and agent initialization
- Test call routing from OSdial campaigns to AI agents

### 2. Deployment Configuration
- Finalize environment variable configuration
- Document deployment process for OSdial/Asterisk environments
- Create startup scripts and service definitions

### 3. Testing and Validation
- Test inbound call handling with AI agents
- Test outbound campaign calls with AI agents
- Validate audio quality and conversation flow
- Measure system performance under load

### 4. Documentation
- Complete integration documentation for OSdial administrators
- Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Document monitoring and maintenance procedures

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Integration Approach
**Decision Needed**: Whether to implement AI agents as:
1. Remote agents in OSdial with dedicated extensions
2. Custom dialplan destinations for campaigns
3. A hybrid approach with both options

**Considerations**:
- Remote agent approach provides better integration with OSdial reporting
- Custom dialplan may offer more flexibility for specialized routing
- Implementation complexity varies between approaches

### Scaling Strategy
**Decision Needed**: How to scale the application for handling multiple concurrent calls

**Considerations**:
- Current port allocation system limits concurrent calls to the configured port range
- Node.js single-process model may become a bottleneck with high concurrency
- Options include horizontal scaling with multiple instances or vertical scaling with optimized resource usage

### Error Handling
**Decision Needed**: How to handle various failure scenarios

**Considerations**:
- ElevenLabs API connectivity issues
- Asterisk connection failures
- Audio processing errors
- Resource exhaustion (ports, memory, etc.)

### Monitoring and Logging
**Decision Needed**: What metrics and logs to capture for operational monitoring

**Considerations**:
- Call success/failure rates
- Audio quality metrics
- API response times
- Resource utilization
- Integration with existing monitoring systems

## Current Challenges

1. **OSdial Integration**: Determining the optimal way to integrate with OSdial as virtual/remote agents
2. **Audio Quality**: Ensuring high-quality bidirectional audio with minimal latency
3. **Scalability**: Managing resources efficiently for multiple concurrent calls
4. **Error Recovery**: Implementing robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
5. **Configuration Management**: Simplifying deployment and configuration for various environments
